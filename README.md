# Aurora
Opensource, Windows based 3D engine featuring OpenGL, Qt and C++11.
Project was originally meant to develop into a 4X strategy game inspired by Endless Space.


Currently presenting:
* GUI made with Qt widgets (with CSS styles)
* UI interaction with high usage of signals and slots 
* Resource management (3d models, textures, shaders)
* Ray-tracing for interaction with game objects in 3D space with mouse
* Phong lighting model
* Multithreaded game logic
* Elastic ModelContainer class with child objects
* Fully functional camera
* .obj file parser
* Constellation generator (planar graph with stars as nodes)
* GeometryProvider class which generates primitives such as geospheres, icosahedrons, billboards and adequate UV maps 
* XML file data
* Most game related algorithms wrapped in classes
